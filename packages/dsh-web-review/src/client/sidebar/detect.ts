/**
 * Better-sidebar detection and engagement watcher.
 *
 * The `betterSidebar` service MUST NOT be added to this plugin's cordis
 * inject list: a fiber whose injected service is never provided stays PENDING
 * forever, and the 0812/rc.8 shell boot sweep turns that into a whole-page
 * boot failure ("web boot: N entries did not activate ... waiting for
 * service"). Presence is therefore probed at apply time via ctx.get()
 * (cordis reflection reads a provided service without the inject
 * requirement) and re-probed on every fiber status transition
 * (internal/status), which covers both activation orders and detects the
 * service disappearing when its providing fiber unloads.
